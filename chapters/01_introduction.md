# Why This Book?

I've observed that there are certain areas of CSS that seem to fluster and confuse many developers in our industry. This is an issue because small, medium, and large teams alike, will tend to:
* Add technical debt as they write poor CSS code
* Miss deadlines because they spend too much time &ldquo;fighting the DOM&rdquo;
* Stop having fun!

With this in mind, I've decided to focus on primarily on–what I'm calling CSS's *hard parts*–with the hopes that you'll be armed with the foundation that will help you to breeze through the next feature you have to code up. Now *hard parts* is a bit of a misnomer because there are plenty of hard parts we will *not* be addressing. What I will be focusing on, primarily, are parts of CSS that allow you to:
* Create useful components (or modules if you prefer)
* Layout pages and sections of pages

These two core tasks are the day-to-day, in the trenches reality of what a front-end developer or designer must tackle to keep pace with that next feature's technical demands. So what does this mean?

* We'll focus more on core visual formatting and box-model related concepts and quirks than things like *selectors*, fancy CSS3 features. For some reason it seems that developers have much less trouble with the later than the former.

# Tools We'll Be Using

CSS is very hard to understand without lots of live examples and visual aids. We'll use a combination of the following tools as listed:

### Pedantic Examples

We'll use the online tool, [codepen.io](codepen.io) for examples that are mainly pedantic in nature, but help to illustrate a concept or a set of concepts.

### Styleguide Driven Development (or SDD)

We'll also build a small component library as we study the &ldquo;hard parts&rdquo; of CSS since:
* There's nothing like real world examples to bring home CSS's core concepts
* It's always fun to have something useful as an extra benefit of study :)

### Reference Materials

Admittedly, much of the material we'll cover is available directly from the [specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) and, essentially, derivative of that single source of truth. However, my hope is that this content will provide a more accessible coverage of this information and also show how it's applied in a practical way. All said, we will be heavily referencing the following excellent materials (all of which you should strongly consider adding to your collection of &ldquo;must-read&rdquo; materials if you're really serious about your CSS chops!):

* [CSS 2.1 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/)
The spec is sometimes hard to understand on the first read, but it's always reliable and definitive.

* Eric Meyer's [CSS: The Definitive Guide, Third Edition](http://meyerweb.com/eric/books/css-tdg/)
I think of this text as a sort of annotated and slightly more readable version of the spec (hey, he wrote test specs for CSS itself so he's gotta know the spec…right?!?!). Having them both available is great for cross-reference.

* Russ Weakley's [Slideshare Presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/maxdesign/presentations)
I'll be linking to some of my favorites of these Slideshares as they are extremely approachable and visual, while–at the same time–accurate and trustworthy.

* [CSS Mastery](http://www.cssmastery.com/)

Another very useful book that many &ldquo;CSS wizards&rdquo; swear by.
